Inventory Management System - Architecture Documentation

1. System Overview
      
        Inventory Management System is a React-based web application that provides a user-friendly
        interface for managing inventory items. It features a responsive design with dark/light theme
        support and real-time inventory tracking capabilities.

        -> Frontend Framework: React 18.3.1
        -> Language: TypeScript
        -> Styling: Tailwind CSS
        -> Build Tool: Vite
        -> Icons: Lucide React
        -> State Management: React Hooks (useState, useContext)

4. Component Architecture

  Core Components

    src/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── InventoryTable.tsx    # Displays inventory items in a sortable table
    │   └── InventoryForm.tsx     # Handles item creation and editing
    ├── context/
    │   └── ThemeContext.tsx      # Manages application-wide theme state
    ├── types/
    │   └── index.ts             # TypeScript type definitions
    └── App.tsx                  # Main application component

4. Key Features

   4.1 State Management

        -> Uses React's built-in hooks for state management
        -> Implements context API for theme management
        -> Maintains inventory state in the App component

    4.2 Data Flow

        App (Main State)
        ├── Items State
        ├── Category Filter
        ├── Sort Direction
        └── Theme Context

    4.3 Theme System

        -> Supports light and dark modes
        -> Persists theme preference in localStorage
        -> Uses Tailwind CSS for theme-aware styling

5. Key Functionalities

    5.1 Inventory Management

        -> Add new items
        -> Edit existing items
        -> Delete items
        -> Filter by category
        -> Sort by quantity

    5.2 Data Validation

        -> Required field validation
        -> Numeric input validation for quantity and price
        -> Type safety with TypeScript

    5.3 UI/UX Features

        -> Responsive design
        -> Theme switching
        -> Low stock highlighting
        -> Interactive table sorting
        -> Category filtering

6. Performance Considerations

        -> Uses useMemo for optimized filtering and sorting
        -> Implements efficient state updates
        -> Minimizes re-renders with proper component structure

7. Security Considerations

        -> Input sanitization
        -> Type checking with TypeScript
        -> Secure external links with rel="noopener noreferrer"

8. Future Enhancements

        -> Data persistence with backend integration
        -> User authentication
        -> Export/Import functionality
        -> Advanced filtering options
        -> Batch operations

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the application while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and modifications.
